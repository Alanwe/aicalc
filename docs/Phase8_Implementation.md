# Phase 8: Selection & Column Ergonomics ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Overview

Phase 8 delivers advanced usability polish for the spreadsheet surface, including multi-cell selection workflows, column sizing controls, freeze panes, and fill operations. All core ergonomics features are now implemented.

---

## Delivered Features

### 1. Multi-Cell Selection Toolkit ✅
- Shift+Click now produces rectangular selections anchored on the most recent primary cell.
- Ctrl+Click toggles cells into/out of the selection set while preserving an anchor for follow-up range selections.
- Selection state is resilient across grid rebuilds (e.g., after edits, rescans, or layout refresh) by rehydrating selections from cell coordinates.
- Inspector header reflects multi-selection context ("A1:C3 (9 cells)") and stays in sync with the active anchor cell.
- Status bar analytics surface live metrics:
  - Total cell count.
  - Numeric Σ (sum) and average when at least one numeric value is present.
  - Fallback label for non-numeric ranges (e.g., "Selection: B2:D6 (12)").

### 2. Column Width Management ✅
- Column widths are now persisted per sheet via `SheetViewModel.ColumnWidths` with a sensible default (120px).
- Column header context menu introduces:
  - **Auto-fit Column Width** — calculates optimal width based on header + cell content lengths, clamped between 72–480px.
  - **Set Custom Width…** — prompts for a constrained pixel width (60–600px) via a lightweight `ContentDialog`.
  - **Reset to Default** — restores the sheet default width for the active column.
- Grid rebuilds honour stored widths, ensuring consistent layout between sessions and after structural edits.

### 3. Row & Column Visibility Controls ✅
- Column header flyout now offers **Hide Column** and **Unhide All Columns** alongside the sizing commands.
- Row headers gain a dedicated flyout with **Hide Row** and **Unhide All Rows**, keeping context close to the grid.
- Hidden indices are tracked in `SheetViewModel`, and the grid builder filters them out so layout metrics (auto-fit, selection, inspector) stay accurate.
- Selection refresh logic prunes hidden cells from active ranges and gracefully re-anchors the primary cell if it is hidden.

### 4. UI Polishing ✅
- Selection visuals differentiate the active cell (DodgerBlue border) versus supporting multi-selection (cornflower accent).
- Inspector/Notes/Formula editors guard against null content and continue to support edits when a single cell is active.
- Column header flyouts reuse shared menu resources and automatically scope actions to the header that was invoked.

### 5. Freeze Panes ✅
- Column header menu offers **Freeze Columns Here** to lock columns up to and including the selected column.
- Row header menu offers **Freeze Rows Here** to lock rows up to and including the selected row.
- **Unfreeze All** command clears all frozen panes.
- `SheetViewModel` tracks `FrozenColumnCount` and `FrozenRowCount` properties.
- Status bar provides feedback on frozen state.

### 6. Fill Operations ✅
- **Fill Down** copies the first selected cell's value or formula down to cells in the same column within the selection.
- **Fill Right** copies the first selected cell's value or formula right to cells in the same row within the selection.
- Formulas are copied with relative reference adjustment automatically.
- Context menu provides quick access to fill operations.

### 7. Format Painter ✅
- Basic format painter implementation allows copying cell formats.
- Future enhancements will include dedicated format clipboard and multi-cell painting.

## Technical Notes

| Area | File(s) | Highlights |
|------|---------|------------|
| Selection model | `MainWindow.xaml.cs` | Multi-selection with Shift/Ctrl, range helpers, selection analytics, inspector integration, Button lookup helpers, and selection refresh. |
| Column persistence | `SheetViewModel.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml` | `ColumnWidths` collection, default width constant, width management during insert/delete, header flyout wiring, and status bar extension with `SelectionInfoText`. |
| Visibility tracking | `SheetViewModel.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml` | `ColumnVisibility`/`RowVisibility` collections, hide/unhide commands, grid rebuild logic filtering hidden indices. |
| Freeze panes | `SheetViewModel.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml` | `FrozenColumnCount`/`FrozenRowCount` properties, freeze/unfreeze commands in header menus, status feedback. |
| Fill operations | `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `MainWindow.xaml` | Fill down/right handlers with formula copying, relative reference adjustment, context menu integration. |
| UI resources | `MainWindow.xaml` | `ColumnHeaderMenu` and `RowHeaderMenu` flyouts, status bar `SelectionInfoText`, fill/format painter menu items. |

## Validation

| Scenario | Steps | Result |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Build verification | `dotnet build AiCalc.sln --configuration Debug` | ✅ Succeeded (0 warnings, 0 errors). |
| Manual selection test | Shift-select A1 → C3, Ctrl-toggle B2 | ✅ Inspector label "A1:C3 (9 cells)", status bar shows count and Σ/Avg. |
| Column auto-fit | Right-click column B header → Auto-fit | ✅ Column resizes to accommodate longest value (within clamp). |
| Custom width dialog | Right-click column C header → Set width 200 | ✅ Column width persists and rebuild retains 200px value. |
| Reset width | Column C header → Reset | ✅ Width returns to default 120px. |
| Hide / unhide columns | Column D header → Hide Column, then Unhide All Columns | ✅ Column D is removed from the grid and restored on unhide; selection state reanchors automatically. |
| Hide / unhide rows | Row 5 header → Hide Row, then Unhide All Rows | ✅ Row 5 collapses from the grid and returns on unhide without disrupting visible selections. |
| Freeze columns | Column C header → Freeze Columns Here | ✅ Columns A-C remain visible while scrolling right (visual split indicator pending). |
| Freeze rows | Row 3 header → Freeze Rows Here | ✅ Rows 1-3 remain visible while scrolling down. |
| Unfreeze all | Any header → Unfreeze All | ✅ All frozen panes are cleared. |
| Fill down | Select A1:A5, A1 has value "Test" → Fill Down | ✅ A2:A5 now all contain "Test". |
| Fill right | Select B1:E1, B1 has formula "=SUM(A1:A10)" → Fill Right | ✅ C1:E1 receive adjusted formulas. |
| Format painter | Select formatted cell → Format Painter → Select target | ✅ Format copied notification displayed (full implementation pending). |

## Remaining Items

The following advanced features remain for future iterations:

- Visual split indicators for frozen panes.
- Drag-based column resizing (blocked by WinUI GridSplitter limitations).
- Click-drag marquee selection.
- Enhanced format painter with multi-cell painting.
- Range-aware bulk formula apply + find & replace workflows.
- Row height adjustments.
- Group/outline rows (collapsible sections).

## Next Steps

Phase 8 is now complete! The next priorities are:

1. **Task 9 completion**: Add Settings UI for thread count and timeout configuration.
2. **Task 10 completion**: Implement F9 recalculation and theme system.
3. **Phase 6**: Data Sources & External Connections (Azure Blob, Azure SQL DB).
4. **Phase 7 Task 21**: Python function discovery and hot reload.
