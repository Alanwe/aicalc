## Completed Features

### 1. Settings Persistence âœ…

**Files Created:**
- `UserPreferences.cs` - Model for user settings (window size, panel states, theme, recent files)
- `UserPreferencesService.cs` - JSON persistence to %LocalAppData%\AiCalc\preferences.json

**Integration:**
- Loads preferences on app startup
- Saves preferences on window close
- Restores window size, panel widths, theme selection
- Tracks recent workbooks (up to 10)

**Testing:** Window size, panel states, and theme preferences persist across app restarts.

### 2. Undo/Redo System âœ…

**Files Created:**
- `CellChangeAction.cs` - Immutable action record (value, formula, format, mode changes)
- `UndoRedoManager.cs` - Stack-based command history (max 50 actions)

**Integration:**
- Automatic recording in `CellViewModel.AppendHistory()`
- `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` in `WorkbookViewModel`
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+Z` (Undo), `Ctrl+Y` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Redo)
- Status messages: "â†¶ Undo: Edit Cell", "â†· Redo: Format Cell"

**Testing:** Undo/redo works for cell value changes, formula edits, and format changes.

### 3. Formula Syntax Highlighting âœ…

**Files Created:**
- `FormulaSyntaxHighlighter.cs` - Tokenizer for formula parsing

**Features:**
- Identifies: Functions (blue), Cell References (green), Strings (red), Numbers (teal), Operators (gray)
- Real-time token counting: "ðŸ’¡ 2 functions, 3 cell refs"
- Handles sheet references (Sheet1!A1)
- Updates as user types

**Testing:** Tokenization works correctly for complex formulas with multiple token types.
