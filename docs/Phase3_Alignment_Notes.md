# Phase 3 Implementation Alignment Notes

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** Implementation vs Requirements Review

---

## Overview

This document tracks alignment between the Phase 3 implementation and the updated requirements in `tasks.md` where the user answered outstanding questions after initial implementation.

---

## Task 8: Dependency Graph (DAG) Implementation ‚úÖ

### Requirements from tasks.md
- **Circular references**: "An Error should be flagged"
- **Dependency visualization**: "The dependency shouldnt normally be visualised, this should be managed quietly as Excel does it."

### Implementation Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- ‚úÖ Circular references detected and error flagged: `#CIRCULAR!` error with cycle path
- ‚úÖ No UI visualization - managed internally like Excel
- ‚úÖ DAG structure working correctly
- ‚úÖ Topological sort implemented

**No changes needed for Task 8.**

---

## Task 9: Multi-Threaded Cell Evaluation ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Requirements from tasks.md
1. **Default timeout**: "We should default to 100 seconds, this should be configurable at the AI Service definition"
2. **Thread count**: "This would be good as an option in the settings menu"

### Implementation Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE

#### ‚úÖ Completed
- Changed default timeout from 30 seconds to 100 seconds
- Exposed `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` property (settable, defaults to CPU count)
- Exposed `DefaultTimeoutSeconds` property (settable, defaults to 100)
- Changed fields from `readonly` to allow runtime configuration

#### ‚è≥ Remaining Work
1. **Settings Menu Integration** (Not yet implemented)
   - Need to add Settings dialog with:
     - Thread count slider/input (MaxDegreeOfParallelism)
     - Default timeout input (DefaultTimeoutSeconds)
     - Per-AI-service timeout configuration
   - Settings should persist to WorkbookSettings or user preferences
   - SheetViewModel should read settings and configure EvaluationEngine

2. **AI Service-Specific Timeout** (Not yet implemented)
   - Currently timeout is global across all evaluations
   - Should support per-service timeout configuration
   - Needs integration with WorkspaceConnection model
   - Example: Ollama might need 200s, while Azure OpenAI needs 60s

**Code Changes Made:**
```csharp
// Before
private readonly int _maxDegreeOfParallelism;
private readonly int _defaultTimeoutSeconds;
// Constructor defaultTimeoutSeconds = 30

// After  
private int _maxDegreeOfParallelism; // Now settable
private int _defaultTimeoutSeconds; // Now settable

public int MaxDegreeOfParallelism { get; set; } // Exposed property
public int DefaultTimeoutSeconds { get; set; } // Exposed property
// Constructor defaultTimeoutSeconds = 100
```

## Task 10: Cell Change Visualization ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Requirements from tasks.md
1. **Color customization**: "Yes please. Perhaps some set themes which can be customised further?"
2. **Recalculate all button**: "Yes and also this should be available as F9 like excel. However this should not apply to cells flagged to manual which should be excluded."

### Implementation Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY COMPLETE

#### ‚úÖ Completed
- 7 visual states implemented (Normal, JustUpdated, Calculating, Stale, ManualUpdate, Error, InDependencyChain)
- Color-coded borders via CellVisualStateToBrushConverter
- Flash effect (green for 2 seconds)
- MarkAsStale(), MarkAsCalculating(), MarkAsUpdated() methods

#### ‚è≥ Remaining Work

1. **Theme System** (Not yet implemented)
   - Hardcoded colors in CellVisualStateToBrushConverter:
     ```csharp
     JustUpdated ‚Üí LimeGreen
     Calculating ‚Üí Orange
     Stale ‚Üí DodgerBlue
     Error ‚Üí Red
     InDependencyChain ‚Üí Yellow
     ```
   - Need theme system with predefined themes:
     - Light theme (current colors)
     - Dark theme (adjusted for dark background)
     - High contrast theme
     - Custom theme (user-configurable)
   - Store theme selection in Settings
   - Apply theme colors from resources/theme dictionary

2. **F9 Recalculate All** (Not yet implemented)
   - Keyboard shortcut F9 should trigger full recalculation
   - Must skip cells with `AutomationMode.Manual`
   - Implementation needed:
     - Add KeyBinding for F9 in MainWindow.xaml
     - Add RecalculateAllCommand to SheetViewModel
     - Filter out Manual cells in evaluation
     - Show progress indicator during recalc

3. **Recalculate All Button** (Not yet implemented)
   - Add button to UI (toolbar or menu)
   - Same behavior as F9
   - Visual feedback during operation

**Current Hardcoded Colors:**
```csharp
public object Convert(object value, Type targetType, object parameter, string language)
{
    if (value is CellVisualState state)
    {
        return state switch
        {
            CellVisualState.JustUpdated => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.LimeGreen),
            CellVisualState.Calculating => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Orange),
            CellVisualState.Stale => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.DodgerBlue),
            CellVisualState.ManualUpdate => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Orange),
            CellVisualState.Error => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Red),
            CellVisualState.InDependencyChain => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Yellow),
            _ => new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Transparent)
        };
    }
    return new SolidColorBrush(Colors.Transparent);
}
```

## Summary of Remaining Work

### High Priority
1. **F9 Recalculate All** (Task 10)
   - KeyBinding in XAML
   - RecalculateAllCommand in SheetViewModel
   - Skip Manual cells in EvaluationEngine

2. **Settings Menu - Thread Count** (Task 9)
   - Add Settings dialog UI
   - Persist MaxDegreeOfParallelism setting
   - Wire up to EvaluationEngine

### Medium Priority
3. **Theme System** (Task 10)
   - Create theme resource dictionaries
   - Predefined themes (Light, Dark, High Contrast)
   - Theme selector in Settings

4. **Recalculate All Button** (Task 10)
   - Add to toolbar/ribbon
   - Same logic as F9

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
5. **Per-Service Timeout Configuration** (Task 9)
   - Extend WorkspaceConnection model
   - Service-specific timeout overrides
   - UI for per-service settings

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Complete Phase 3 Fully
Implement the remaining Task 9 and Task 10 features:
1. Add F9 recalculation (1-2 hours)
2. Create Settings dialog with thread count (2-3 hours)
3. Implement theme system (4-5 hours)
4. Add recalculate button (30 minutes)

**Total estimated time: 8-11 hours**

### Option 2: Document and Move On
- Document the partial completion status
- Mark Phase 3 as "mostly complete" with known gaps
- Continue to Phase 4 (AI Functions) or Phase 2 (Cell Operations)
- Return to complete Settings/Themes later as a polish phase

### Option 3: Minimal Compliance
- Implement only F9 recalculation (high value, low effort)
- Add basic Settings dialog for thread count
- Defer theme system to later phase
- **Total estimated time: 3-5 hours**

## Conclusion

### ‚úÖ What's Complete (Production Ready)

The **core technical implementation** of Phase 3 is complete and working:
- ‚úÖ Dependency graph tracks relationships correctly
- ‚úÖ Multi-threaded evaluation works with parallelization
- ‚úÖ Visual feedback system is functional
- ‚úÖ Configurable properties exposed for settings
- ‚úÖ 100-second default timeout implemented
- ‚úÖ Circular reference detection working
- ‚úÖ Progress reporting and cancellation support

**Status**: Core evaluation engine is production-ready and can handle Phase 4 AI functions.

### ‚è≥ What's Pending (User Experience)

The **user-facing features** still need work:
- ‚è≥ Settings UI to configure thread count and timeouts (~3-4 hours)
- ‚è≥ F9 keyboard shortcut for recalculation (~2-3 hours)
- ‚è≥ Recalculate All button (~30 minutes)
- ‚è≥ Theme system for color customization (~4-5 hours)
- ‚è≥ Per-service timeout configuration (~2-3 hours)

**Status**: Essential UX features pending, but not blocking for Phase 4.

### üìã Recommended Action Plan

**Option 1: Minimal Viable (Recommended)** - 5-7 hours
1. Implement F9 recalculation + button (high user value)
2. Create basic Settings dialog with thread count
3. Mark Phase 3 as "Core Complete"
4. Proceed to Phase 4 (AI Functions)
5. Return to themes in Phase 8 (Polish)

**Option 2: Full Completion** - 12-16 hours
1. Implement all remaining features
2. Mark Phase 3 as 100% complete
3. Proceed to Phase 4 with polished UX

**Option 3: Skip to Phase 4** - 0 hours
1. Document pending work
2. Proceed directly to Phase 4
3. Users manually trigger recalc via menu
4. Return to Phase 3 polish later

**Our Recommendation**: **Option 1 (Minimal Viable)**
- F9 is a critical user expectation (Excel muscle memory)
- Settings dialog is professional and expected
- Themes are nice-to-have, can wait
- Gets us to Phase 4 faster with essential UX

### üöÄ Phase 4 Readiness

Phase 3's evaluation engine is **ready for Phase 4** with:
- ‚úÖ Multi-threaded AI function execution
- ‚úÖ 100s timeout (configurable per service later)
- ‚úÖ Progress tracking for long AI operations
- ‚úÖ Error handling and cancellation
- ‚úÖ Dependency management for AI chains

**Verdict**: Proceed to Phase 4, implement F9 and Settings in parallel or after initial AI integration.
